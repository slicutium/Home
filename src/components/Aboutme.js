              <p><strong>Hello!</strong></p>
              <p>I'm Pablo Solis, from Peru!</p>
              <p>I love learning new things and finding solutions. I have found a direct correlation between the difficulty of the task and my drive to finish it. </p>
              <p>I am a Systems Engineer, a Software Developer, and a Pilot. I have flown across the globe for the last 10 years, discovering unique destinations, learning from different cultures, and gaining invaluable experiences working alongside people with diverse backgrounds.</p>
              <p>I am, once again, taking on a big challenge. Some may say a daunting one. I am transitioning back to IT. There have been tremendous changes since I last worked in the field. For me, all those changes point to endless opportunities. <br></br>
              In the past few months, I have been developing my toolbox with knowledge, and practical tools to firmly step into this new challenge. I have obtained Professional Certificates, Specializations, and am continuously learning new technologies like Java, JS, ReactJS, Express, version control systems, and many others.</p>
              <p>Feel free to look around this site, you can see some of my work and professional experience. I will continously update the content with my latest projects</p>
